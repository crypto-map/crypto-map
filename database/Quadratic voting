Vitalik Buterin in collaboration with ZoÃ« Hitzig and E. Glen Weyl proposed quadratic funding, a way to allocate the distribution of funds (for example, from a government's budget, a philanthropic source, or collected directly from participants) based on quadratic voting, noting that such a mechanism allows for optimal production of public goods without needing to be determined by a centralized legislature. Weyl argues that this fills a gap with traditional free markets - which encourage the production of goods and services for the benefit of individuals, but fail to create outcomes desirable to society as a whole - while still benefiting from the flexibility and diversity free markets have compared to many government programs.

The Gitcoin Grants initiative is an early adopter of quadratic funding. Led by Kevin Owocki, Scott Moore, and Vivek Singh, the initiative has distributed more than $2,000,000 to open-source software development projects as of early 2020.
